# Assessment Scoring

This document outlines the systematic approach used to score and interpret the Client Assessment Questionnaire responses. This methodology is designed to identify client types and potential risk factors in a consistent manner.

## Response Scoring

Each response is assigned a numerical value based on the following scale:

| Response | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Strongly agree | +2 |
| Agree | +1 |
| Neutral | 0 |
| Disagree | -1 |
| Strongly disagree | -2 |

## Dimension Calculations

### 1. Internal vs External Expertise Orientation

- **Internal Score**: Sum the scores from questions 1-5 (range: -10 to +10)
- **External Score**: Sum the scores from questions 6-10 (range: -10 to +10)
- **Final I-E Dimension Score**: Internal Score - External Score
  - Positive score indicates Internal orientation
  - Negative score indicates External orientation

### 2. Sensing vs Intuition Information Processing

- **Sensing Score**: Sum the scores from questions 11-15 (range: -10 to +10)
- **Intuition Score**: Sum the scores from questions 16-20 (range: -10 to +10)
- **Final S-N Dimension Score**: Sensing Score - Intuition Score
  - Positive score indicates Sensing preference
  - Negative score indicates Intuition preference

### 3. Thinking vs Feeling Decision-Making

- **Thinking Score**: Sum the scores from questions 21-25 (range: -10 to +10)
- **Feeling Score**: Sum the scores from questions 26-30 (range: -10 to +10)
- **Final T-F Dimension Score**: Thinking Score - Feeling Score
  - Positive score indicates Thinking preference
  - Negative score indicates Feeling preference

### 4. Judging vs Perceiving Approach

- **Judging Score**: Sum the scores from questions 31-35 (range: -10 to +10)
- **Perceiving Score**: Sum the scores from questions 36-40 (range: -10 to +10)
- **Final J-P Dimension Score**: Judging Score - Perceiving Score
  - Positive score indicates Judging preference
  - Negative score indicates Perceiving preference

## Preference Strength Interpretation

For each dimension, the score indicates both direction and strength of preference:

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 7 to 10 (or -7 to -10) | Strong preference |
| 4 to 6 (or -4 to -6) | Moderate preference |
| 1 to 3 (or -1 to -3) | Slight preference |
| 0 | No clear preference |

## Validation Process

This scoring methodology is being validated through:

1. **Retrospective Analysis**: Scoring past clients and correlating with outcomes
2. **Inter-rater Reliability**: Multiple team members scoring the same clients
3. **Predictive Testing**: Prospective testing with new clients

As patterns emerge, both the questionnaire and scoring methodology will be refined to improve accuracy and predictive value.

## Implementation Notes

1. The Excel template automatically calculates all these scores and classifications.
2. The visualization dashboard provides an interactive way to explore client types.
3. For team discussion, focus on dimension scores and patterns rather than just the four-letter code.
4. Document both successes and failures to refine the risk assessment model.

## Visualization

Create a spider/radar chart showing the client's position on each dimension:

```
         Internal (+10)
              |
              |
Perceiving (-10) -- Judging (+10)
              |
              |
         External (-10)
