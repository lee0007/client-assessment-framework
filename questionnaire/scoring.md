## Scoring Matrix Design

### Basic Scoring Approach
For each question, assign points based on the response:
- Strongly agree: +2
- Agree: +1
- Neutral: 0
- Disagree: -1
- Strongly disagree: -2

### Dimension Calculations

For each dimension, we'll calculate scores for both poles separately, then determine where the client falls on the spectrum:

#### 1. Internal vs External Expertise Orientation
- Sum the scores from the 5 Internal questions (I)
- Sum the scores from the 5 External questions (E)
- Final score: I - E (positive = Internal orientation, negative = External orientation)

#### 2. Sensing vs Intuition Information Processing
- Sum the scores from the 5 Sensing questions (S)
- Sum the scores from the 5 Intuition questions (N)
- Final score: S - N (positive = Sensing preference, negative = Intuition preference)

#### 3. Thinking vs Feeling Decision-Making
- Sum the scores from the 5 Thinking questions (T)
- Sum the scores from the 5 Feeling questions (F)
- Final score: T - F (positive = Thinking preference, negative = Feeling preference)

#### 4. Judging vs Perceiving Approach
- Sum the scores from the 5 Judging questions (J)
- Sum the scores from the 5 Perceiving questions (P)
- Final score: J - P (positive = Judging preference, negative = Perceiving preference)

### Interpretation Matrix

For each dimension, the score range is -10 to +10:
- Strong preference: 7 to 10 (or -7 to -10)
- Moderate preference: 4 to 6 (or -4 to -6)
- Slight preference: 1 to 3 (or -1 to -3)
- No clear preference: 0

### Client Type Classification

Based on the four-letter code (similar to MBTI), you'll have 16 possible client types. Here's a preliminary interpretation of what each type might represent in your context:

| Type | Description | Tire Kicker Risk |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| ISTJ | Internal, detail-focused, logical, structured | Low |
| ISFJ | Internal, detail-focused, consensus-oriented, structured | Low-Medium |
| INFJ | Internal, big-picture, consensus-oriented, structured | Medium |
| INTJ | Internal, big-picture, logical, structured | Low |
| ISTP | Internal, detail-focused, logical, flexible | Medium |
| ISFP | Internal, detail-focused, consensus-oriented, flexible | Medium-High |
| INFP | Internal, big-picture, consensus-oriented, flexible | High |
| INTP | Internal, big-picture, logical, flexible | Medium |
| ESTJ | External, detail-focused, logical, structured | Low |
| ESFJ | External, detail-focused, consensus-oriented, structured | Low-Medium |
| ENFJ | External, big-picture, consensus-oriented, structured | Medium |
| ENTJ | External, big-picture, logical, structured | Low |
| ESTP | External, detail-focused, logical, flexible | Medium-High |
| ESFP | External, detail-focused, consensus-oriented, flexible | High |
| ENFP | External, big-picture, consensus-oriented, flexible | High |
| ENTP | External, big-picture, logical, flexible | Medium |

### Additional Risk Factors

Consider adding points to the "Tire Kicker Risk" assessment for:
1. Contradictory answers within dimensions
2. Very neutral responses across all dimensions (might indicate lack of clear vision)
3. Negative responses to the opening questions about problem definition clarity


## Red Flag Combinations

Based on initial hypothesis, these combinations might indicate higher tire kicker risk:
- High External + High Perceiving + Low Thinking (looking for free education with no commitment)
- High Internal + High Feeling + High Perceiving (may have difficulty committing to solutions)
- Very high scores at both ends of any dimension (potentially confused about their needs)

Would you like me to create a specific scoring spreadsheet template for this system, or would you prefer to start with this framework and refine it after collecting initial data? 

## Visualization

Create a spider/radar chart showing the client's position on each dimension:

```
         Internal (+10)
              |
              |
Perceiving (-10) -- Judging (+10)
              |
              |
         External (-10)
