I'd be happy to develop a comprehensive questionnaire for your engineering firm's client assessment. Starting with an opening problem statement and then creating 10 questions (5 for each end) of each dimension will help you identify patterns in client behaviors.

## Opening Questions

1. "Please briefly describe the problem your organization is trying to solve."
   (Open text field)

2. "How clearly defined is your problem at this stage?"
   - Strongly agree
   - Agree
   - Neutral
   - Disagree
   - Strongly disagree

3. "We have a clear idea of what an ideal solution would look like."
   - Strongly agree
   - Agree
   - Neutral
   - Disagree
   - Strongly disagree

## Dimension 1: Internal vs External Expertise Orientation

**Internal Orientation (5 questions)**
1. "We prefer to use our own team's expertise to guide solution development."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

2. "External consultants should primarily implement our pre-defined solution approach."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

3. "The most valuable insights about our problem come from within our organization."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

4. "We need partners who can execute our vision rather than redefine it."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

5. "Our organization has the necessary expertise to define the technical requirements; we just need help with implementation."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

**External Orientation (5 questions)**
1. "We value external perspectives that challenge our assumptions about the problem."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

2. "The right external partner should bring specialized expertise we don't have internally."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

3. "We expect consultants to significantly shape how we define our problem and approach."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

4. "External specialists typically understand industry best practices better than our internal team."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

5. "We're open to completely rethinking our approach based on expert recommendations."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

## Dimension 2: Sensing vs Intuition Information Processing

**Sensing (5 questions)**
1. "We need concrete, specific examples of how a solution has worked elsewhere."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

2. "Detailed technical specifications are more important than abstract concepts."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

3. "We prefer step-by-step implementation plans over broad strategic frameworks."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

4. "Practical, immediate results matter more than long-term theoretical benefits."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

5. "We want to focus on solving the specific problem at hand rather than exploring related opportunities."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

**Intuition (5 questions)**
1. "We're interested in how this solution connects to our broader organizational strategy."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

2. "We value innovative approaches even if they haven't been widely tested."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

3. "Understanding the underlying patterns and principles is more important than specific implementation details."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

4. "We're interested in exploring multiple possible approaches before committing to one direction."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

5. "We value partners who help us see possibilities we hadn't considered."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

## Dimension 3: Thinking vs Feeling Decision-Making

**Thinking (5 questions)**
1. "Decisions about this project should be based primarily on objective data and metrics."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

2. "Technical performance and efficiency are more important than ease of adoption by users."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

3. "Project success should be measured by quantifiable outcomes rather than stakeholder satisfaction."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

4. "We prefer direct, candid feedback over diplomatically phrased suggestions."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

5. "Logical consistency is more important than organizational consensus when evaluating solutions."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

**Feeling (5 questions)**
1. "How a solution affects our team's morale and culture is a critical consideration."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

2. "Building consensus among stakeholders is essential before moving forward."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

3. "We value partners who understand our organization's values and priorities."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

4. "The right solution needs to address emotional and interpersonal factors, not just technical requirements."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

5. "We prefer working with consultants who invest time in understanding our team dynamics."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

## Dimension 4: Judging vs Perceiving Approach to External World

**Judging (5 questions)**
1. "We expect to define clear project milestones and timelines before beginning work."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

2. "Once a project plan is established, we prefer to follow it with minimal changes."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

3. "We value partners who deliver exactly what was agreed upon in the initial scope."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

4. "Ambiguity and uncertainty in project parameters should be resolved at the outset."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

5. "We prefer to make decisions quickly and commit to a clear direction."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

**Perceiving (5 questions)**
1. "We expect the project scope to evolve as we learn more about the problem."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

2. "Flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances is more important than adhering to the original plan."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

3. "We're comfortable with an exploratory approach that may lead in unexpected directions."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

4. "We value partners who can help us navigate uncertainty rather than eliminate it."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

5. "We prefer to keep our options open rather than committing to a single solution too early."
   - Strongly agree to Strongly disagree

## Final Assessment Questions

1. "Have you worked with engineering consultants in the past?"
   - Yes/No

2. "If yes, what aspects of those relationships were most valuable to your organization?"
   (Open text field)

3. "What is your timeline for implementing a solution to this problem?"
   (Multiple choice with ranges)

4. "What is your anticipated budget range for this project?"
   (Multiple choice with ranges)
