### 1. Research hypothesis:
The proposed hypothesis is that client behaviors may follow discernible patterns that could be categorized along four dimensions, similar to the Myers-Briggs psychological typing systems. as a framework for investigation.

Internal vs External (I/E) - Where they believe expertise resides
Sensing vs Intuition (S/N) - How they process information about their problem
Judging vs Feeling (T/F) - Their decision-making approach
Thinking vs Perceiving (J/P) - Their self-awareness and approach to external factors

As a research project this is an investigation into potential patterns of behaviour which could be valuable if we can identify clear correlations between certain dimensions, combinations and client outcomes. 

### 2. Research Question

"Can we predict prospective client behavior and resource requirements by assessing past, present, and future client characteristics along the four dimensions, and does this provide statistically significant value in identifying 'tire kickers' before they consume valuable team resources?"

### 3. CUrrent Limitations

- No empirical validation yet
- Potential for oversimplification of complex behaviors
- Possible biases in the assessment design
- Need for robust statistical validation

### 4. The Experimental Design

1. **Retrospective Analysis Phase**:
   - Apply the questionnaire to past clients from memory
   - Test inter-rater reliability among team members
   - Look for correlations between assessed type and actual outcomes

2. **Prospective Testing Phase**:
   - Apply the assessment to new prospects
   - Track outcomes against predictions
   - Establish statistical significance thresholds

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Regular assessment of question effectiveness
   - Modification of dimensions as needed
   - Potential exploration of alternative models

### 5. Focus on Measurement and Metrics

We could quantify success in terms of:

- Time saved in business development
- Correlation between type assessment and project success
- False positive/negative rates in "tyre kicker" identification
- ROI calculation methodology

### 6. Demonstrate the Tools

Present the Excel template and visualization as research instruments: These are not final products but potential research tools to help us collect, analyze, and visualize data during our investigation.

### 7. Establish Testing Timeline

Indicative only:

- Phase 1 (2 weeks): Retrospective assessment of past clients
- Phase 2 (1 month): Prospective testing with new prospects
- Phase 3 (2 weeks): Initial data analysis and refinement
- Phase 4 (3 months): Extended testing with refined model
- Phase 5 (2 weeks): Comprehensive statistical analysis

### 8. Invite Methodological Critique

Requesting critical feedback on:

- Statistical methodology
- Potential confounding variables
- Alternative testing approaches
- Improved measurement techniques
