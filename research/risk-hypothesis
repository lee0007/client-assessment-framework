# Risk Assessment Hypothesis

The risk scores (ranging from 1-7) are assigned based on theoretical hypotheses about which personality types might be more prone to "tyre kicker" behavior in an engineering consulting context. These are educated guesses that need validation through the research process.
As part of the research methodology, and based on collected data, we would assess/refine/replace the following theoretical assignments with empirically derived values, if possible. These initial risk scores are hypothetical starting points, variables to be tested, not facts. The research process aims to determine whether these patterns exist using past, present, and future client observations to confirm or contradict these initial assignments
The risk assessment combines several factors:

## 1. Base Risk Score by Type

As a starting hypothesis, each client type was assigned an associated base risk score:

| Type | Base Risk |
|------|-----------|
| ISTJ | 1 |
| ISFJ | 2 |
| INFJ | 4 |
| INTJ | 1 |
| ISTP | 3 |
| ISFP | 5 |
| INFP | 6 |
| INTP | 3 |
| ESTJ | 1 |
| ESFJ | 2 |
| ENFJ | 3 |
| ENTJ | 1 |
| ESTP | 5 |
| ESFP | 6 |
| ENFP | 7 |
| ENTP | 4 |

### Base Risk Score Logic

The logic behind the assignments follows these patterns:

*Lower Risk (1-2):* Types with both structured (J) and analytical (T) preferences (ISTJ, INTJ, ESTJ, ENTJ) were assigned lower risk scores because they theoretically would:

- Make decisions more quickly and definitively
- Value efficiency and clear outcomes
- Have well-defined project parameters before engaging consultants

*Medium Risk (3-4):* Types that have either structure (J) or analysis (T) but not both were assigned medium risk because they have some decision-making clarity but may lack other components:

- ISTP, INTP: Analytical but may explore multiple possibilities without committing
- ENFJ: Structured but may prioritize consensus over decisive action

*Higher Risk (5-7):* Types with both flexible (P) and relationship-focused (F) preferences (ISFP, INFP, ESFP, ENFP) were assigned higher risk scores based on the hypothesis that they might:

- Prefer exploring multiple options without making firm commitments
- Value the relationship and learning process itself, potentially more than outcomes
- Be more comfortable with evolving project scope and less-defined deliverables

### Red Flag Combinations

Additional points are added to the risk score based on:

1. **Contradictory Answers**: If high scores occur at both ends of any dimension
   - Strong scores in both Internal AND External: +2 points
   - Strong scores in both Sensing AND Intuition: +2 points
   - Strong scores in both Thinking AND Feeling: +2 points
   - Strong scores in both Judging AND Perceiving: +2 points

2. **Neutral Responses**: Lack of clear preferences across dimensions
   - If all dimension scores have an absolute value less than 2: +3 points

3. **Unclear Problem Definition**: Based on opening questions
   - If problem clarity question score is negative: +2 points

## Total Risk Score and Interpretation

The total risk score is the sum of the base risk and additional risk factors:

| Total Risk Score | Risk Level | Interpretation |
|------------------|------------|----------------|
| 1-3 | LOW | Likely to be a good fit with clear needs and decision process |
| 4-6 | MEDIUM | May require additional qualification before committing resources |
| 7+ | HIGH | Significant potential for "tyre kicking" - proceed with caution |
