# Client Assessment Framework

## Hypothesis
This project explores whether client behaviors follow discernible patterns that can help identify "tyre kickers" before they consume valuable team resources.

## Background
We often spend significant time with prospective clients who never convert. This framework adapts concepts from personality typing systems to categorize client approaches along four dimensions:

- Internal vs External Expertise Orientation
- Sensing vs Intuition Information Processing
- Thinking vs Feeling Decision-Making
- Judging vs Perceiving Approach

## Tools Included
1. [Questionnaire](./questionnaire/questions.md) - Assessment questions with scoring methodology
2. [Excel Template](./excel/client-assessment-template.xlsx) - Scoring and analysis spreadsheet
3. [Interactive Visualization](https://yourusername.github.io/client-assessment-framework/visualization/) - Visual representation of client types

## Research Methodology
This is an experimental approach currently in the testing phase. See our [research methodology](./research/methodology.md) for details on validating this framework.
