# Client Assessment Framework

## Project Hypothesis

By adapting concepts from business qualification frameworks (BAMT, MEDDIC) and personality typing systems like Myers-Briggs this project explores whether client problem /solution behaviors follow discernible patterns that can help identify and prioritise potential clients and allocate appropriate team resources.

## The Problem

Investing significant time with prospective clients that don't convert into long-term business is a prevalent challenge in many B2B and consultancy-driven industries. This issue not only drains valuable resources but can also impact team morale and strategic focus.

### Understanding the Core Issue
1. High Cost of Time
2. Misaligned Expectations
3. Lack of Structured Qualification
4. Inefficient Sales Process
5. Data Gaps

### Strategies to Address the Challenge
1. Implement Lead Qualification Frameworks
2. Tiered Engagement Model
3. Set Clear ROI Metrics
4. Offer Paid Discovery Phases
5. Utilize CRM and Pipeline Analytics

## Potential Solution 

This project advances the development of a structured qualification process to pre-screen access to leadership and reduce time spent on non-converting prospects, thereby improving efficiency and focusing efforts on high-potential opportunities. We're investigating the potential of a client assessment framework that incorporates BANT, and MEDDIC lead qualification frameworks and four key dimensions that may be indicative of prospective client behavior patterns:

### 1. Internal vs External Expertise Orientation
How clients view the source of expertise needed to define their current problems and solutions:
- **Internal**: Believes their organization possesses most necessary expertise
- **External**: Values outside perspective and specialized knowledge

### 2. Sensing vs Intuition Information Processing
How clients take in and process information about their problems:
- **Sensing**: Focuses on concrete details, precedents, and practical applications
- **Intuition**: Emphasizes patterns, possibilities, and broader implications

### 3. Thinking vs Feeling Decision-Making
How clients approach decision-making:
- **Thinking**: Prioritizes logic, data, and objective metrics
- **Feeling**: Values consensus, stakeholder impact, and organizational harmony

### 4. Judging vs Perceiving Approach
How clients deal with the external world:
- **Judging**: Prefers clear structure, defined outcomes, and minimal changes
- **Perceiving**: Values flexibility, exploration, and adaptation during the process

## Assessment Tools

This repository contains three key components:

1. **[Questionnaire](./questionnaire/questions.md)**: A 40-question assessment (10 questions per dimension) that business development team members and prospective clients can complete
2. **[Excel Template](./excel/client-assessment-template.xlsx)**: A scoring spreadsheet that calculates dimension scores and identifies client types
3. **[Interactive Visualization](./visualization/)**: A dashboard for exploring client profiles and risk assessments

## Research Approach

This framework is currently in an experimental phase. The proposed research methodology includes:

### Phase 1: Retrospective Analysis
- Apply the questionnaire to past and present clients (from memory)
- Test inter-rater reliability among team members
- Identify patterns in successful vs. unsuccessful client engagements

### Phase 2: Prospective Testing
- Implement the questionnaire with new prospects
- Track outcomes against predictions
- Refine and validate the model

### Phase 3: Statistical Validation
- Analyze correlation between type classifications and business outcomes
- Identify the most predictive questions and dimensions
- Develop a refined, evidence-based framework

## How to Contribute

As engineering and scientific professionals, your critical input is essential to this experimental approach. We welcome your contributions:

1. **Methodology Feedback**: Suggest improvements to the assessment design
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Help develop robust validation approaches
3. **Question Refinement**: Identify more effective questions for each dimension
4. **Case Studies**: Contribute experiences with different client types
